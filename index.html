            <h1>A Little Intro Of Our Friend</h1>
            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, larger only
                than Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial
                planet with a thin atmosphere and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust,
                as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys,
                dunes, and polar ice caps. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.Some of the
                most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest-known
                mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The
                Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large
                impact feature. Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar
                rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the
                surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric
                pressure on Earth. Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. In the distant
                past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. It is not known whether life has
                ever existed on Mars.

            <h1>Can We Live on Our Neighbouring Planet </h1>
            <h2>Mars X Earth</h2>
            <p>Colonization or settlement of Mars is the theoretical human migration and long-term human establishment of Mars. The prospect has garnered interest from public space agencies and private corporations and has been extensively explored in science fiction writing, film, and art.Organizations have proposed plans for a human mission to Mars, the first step towards any colonization effort, but no person has set foot on the planet, and there have been no return missions. However, landers and rovers have successfully explored the planetary surface and delivered information about conditions on the ground.
            Mars' orbit is close to Earth's orbit and the asteroid belt. While Mars' day and general composition are similar to Earth, the planet is hostile to life. Mars has an unbreathable atmosphere, thin enough that its temperature on average fluctuates between −70 and 0 °C (−94 and 32 °F), yet thick enough to cause planet-wide dust storms. The barren landscape on Mars is covered by fine dust and intense ionizing radiation. Mars has in-situ resources, such as underground water, Martian soil, and ore, which could be leveraged by colonists. Opportunities to generate electricity via wind, solar, and nuclear power using resources on Mars are poor.
